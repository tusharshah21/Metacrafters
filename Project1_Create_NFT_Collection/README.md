# JS Assessment Project: Minting NFTs

This project simulates the minting of NFTs using JavaScript. The project brings together various JavaScript concepts and adds a touch of Web3 flavor to create and manage NFTs. Each NFT is represented by an object that holds its metadata, and the NFTs are stored in an array. The metadata can include any values you want, such as name, description, price, and image.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following key components:
1. A variable to hold all NFTs.
2. A function to mint (create) an NFT with specific metadata.
3. A function to list all NFTs and print their metadata to the console.
4. A function to get the total number of NFTs minted.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Variable to Hold NFTs

We use an array to store all NFTs.

```javascript
const NFTs = [];
